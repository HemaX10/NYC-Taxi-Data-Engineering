There is a huge problem facing you which is making postgres and airflow not working well
after it was doing good what I identified causing the problem that queries does not run and how ?
when executing this query : 
"SELECT blocked_locks.pid AS blocked_pid,
       blocking_locks.pid AS blocking_pid,
       blocked_activity.usename AS blocked_user,
       blocking_activity.usename AS blocking_user,
       blocked_activity.query AS blocked_statement,
       blocking_activity.query AS current_statement_in_blocking_process
FROM  pg_locks blocked_locks
JOIN pg_stat_activity blocked_activity
ON blocked_activity.pid = blocked_locks.pid
JOIN pg_locks blocking_locks 
ON blocking_locks.locktype = blocked_locks.locktype
AND blocking_locks.database IS NOT DISTINCT FROM blocked_locks.database
AND blocking_locks.relation IS NOT DISTINCT FROM blocked_locks.relation
AND blocking_locks.page IS NOT DISTINCT FROM blocked_locks.page
AND blocking_locks.tuple IS NOT DISTINCT FROM blocked_locks.tuple
AND blocking_locks.virtualxid IS NOT DISTINCT FROM blocked_locks.virtualxid
AND blocking_locks.transactionid IS NOT DISTINCT FROM blocked_locks.transactionid
AND blocking_locks.classid IS NOT DISTINCT FROM blocked_locks.classid
AND blocking_locks.objid IS NOT DISTINCT FROM blocked_locks.objid
AND blocking_locks.objsubid IS NOT DISTINCT FROM blocked_locks.objsubid
AND blocking_locks.pid != blocked_locks.pid
JOIN pg_stat_activity blocking_activity
ON blocking_activity.pid = blocking_locks.pid;" 

SELECT pg_terminate_backend(blocking_pid);

It retures 20 queries of merging data been executing , how I got to this point becuase this message in 
postgres log "2025-05-06 09:12:32.014 UTC [1736] LOG: skipping vacuum of "green_staging" --- lock not available"
which makes me to idnetify the problem , before I start solving it I just need to see why this happend
to not making it happen again 

Problemmmmmmmmmmmmmmm: !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
problem : airflow stops saying that : """
airflow.exceptions.AirflowException: Task received SIGTERM signal
[2025-05-08, 15:37:51 UTC] {taskinstance.py:1398} INFO - Marking task as 
FAILED. dag_id=ny_taxi_loader, task_id=fhv_group.process_fhv_2019_11,

(pid=1437, status='terminated', exitcode=1, started='15:31:12') (1437) terminated with
exit code 1)) Then make task up for retry and makes all reties then no solution as expected 

Solution : 
add two paratmers in default args one is retry_delta and execution_timeout which both take time
from timedelta , 
What it is: retry_delay specifies the amount of time Airflow should wait before 
attempting to run a task again after it has failed. 
If a task instance fails, and there are retries remaining, 
Airflow will wait for the duration specified by retry_delay before 
scheduling the next attempt.

Purpose:
Handles transient issues: If a task fails due to a temporary problem 
e.g., a network glitch, a database being briefly unavailable or overloaded, a rate limit), 
retry_delay gives that external system or condition some time to recover before Airflow 
tries again.
Example: datetime.timedelta(minutes=5) means wait 5 minutes.

What it is: execution_timeout specifies the maximum amount of time a single attempt of a task is allowed to run.

What happens if it's exceeded
Airflow sends a SIGTERM signal to the process running the task. This is a "polite" request for the task to shut down cleanly.
The task instance is then marked as FAILED (or UP_FOR_RETRY if retries are still available).


Purpose:
Prevents runaway tasks: It stops tasks that are stuck in an infinite loop, 
waiting indefinitely for a resource, or simply taking far longer than 
expected from consuming resources (CPU, memory, worker slots) indefinitely.
Maintains DAG health: Ensures that a single misbehaving task doesn't stall 
an entire DAG or exhaust system resources.

Example: datetime.timedelta(minutes=30)

Problem : !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
//// another problem I have faced which is docker takes a lot of context when he is been building and this takes a lot of time , lets try to solve it.
 “”” transferring context: 14.18GB 1378.3s  “””
•	What is "Context"? The build context is the set of files and directories located in the path specified by build.context in your docker-compose.yml (or the directory containing the Dockerfile if not specified). Docker sends all of this to the daemon before the build starts.
And to solve this is issue we use .dockerignore which we but in it all things we do not use that docker takes it before start building



Problem : !!!!!!!!!!!!
Quires take so much time over all ETL 
solution : run this inside SET maintenance_work_mem = '1GB';  
change the wslconfing for docker to increase resources also make the same 
for postgres inside docker compose yml using this line 
command: postgres -c work_mem=512MB -c maintenance_work_mem=2GB -c shared_buffers=256MB -c statement_timeout=0
